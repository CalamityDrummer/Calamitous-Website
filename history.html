    <h3 class="history"><b>Early Beginnings</b></h3>
    <p>The 5-piece heavy metal band Calamitous was birthed by drummer Savva Belavsky-Levitan,
        guitarist Francis Healy and guitarist later bassist AOC in school. Soon enough Tristan 
        Bond was recruited as the lead singer. It didn't take long for them to start demoing 
        songs they had in their back pocket. The first one being 'Silent Screams'. But tensions
        were high which ended up in AOC getting fired for not being cooperative with the band. After
        which the band went into troubled times as Tristan had to go on a small hiatus from the band 
        for family reasons leaving just Savva and Francis on their own for sometime before Tristan 
        was back in full shape in the summer of 2024. Over the few months they refined their skills
        and songwriting and recorded their first single 'Silent Screams' before the end of the year.
